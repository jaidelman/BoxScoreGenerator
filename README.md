This program writes a box score in the correct reddit formatting for Reddit Fake Baseball.
Rosters can be accessed at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JxXUlVbF_c72OA_f9wdykNNkJ0k4Z49vsUl8J-qNzJA/edit#gid=1589808090

To use it you must save the two teams rosters as CSV files, then run the program. The program
will ask you for the team names, the file names and then for the player name and position of each
player in the game. The program then writes a file called awayTeamHomeTeam.txt with the formatted
box score, inlcuding each player's name, username, and avg/era. You can then copy/paste the file
directly into a new text post on old.reddit.com/r/fakebaseball to produce a box score.

Once running, the program will prompt you for the team names, and the csv files with the rosters for each team.
You'll then have to input the player names and positions for each team, and it will give you a text file with a box score
that you can copy/paste directly into a new text post on old.reddit.com/r/fakebaseball.
