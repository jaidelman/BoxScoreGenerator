This program writes a box score in the correct reddit formatting for Reddit Fake Baseball.

To use it you must save the two teams rosters as CSV files, then run the program. The program
will ask you for the team names, the file names and then for the player name and position of each
player in the game. The program then writes a file called awayTeamHomeTeam.txt with the formatted
box score, which you can copy/paste directly into a new text post on old.reddit.com/r/fakebaseball.
