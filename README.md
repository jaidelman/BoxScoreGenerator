This program writes a box score in the correct reddit formatting for Reddit Fake Baseball.

To use it you must save the two teams rosters as CSV files, then run the program. The program
will ask you for the team names, the file names and then for the player name and position of each
player in the game. The program then writes a file called awayTeamHomeTeam.txt with the formatted
box score, which you can copy/paste directly into a new text post on old.reddit.com/r/fakebaseball.

Make sure you have both BoxScore.java and Player.java in the same directory, and compile with javac *.java.
You can then run it by typing java BoxScore in your command line. The program will prompt you for the team
names, and the csv files with the rosters for each team. You'll then have to input the player names and positions
for each team, and it will give you a text file with a box sscore you can copy/paste directly into a new text post on old.reddit.com/r/fakebaseball.
